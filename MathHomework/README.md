# Math homework

Roberto is a young student at _"eche"_ school who likes mathematics and computer science. One day
his math teacher set him a challenge, to create an algorithm that, given a number K, would find two
prime numbers (A and B) that multiplied together would give the same number. Roberto has no idea
where to start. He helps Roberto build the algorithm.

__Inputs:__ <br/>
The first input is an integer P representing the number of test cases. For each test case you will
receive an integer K representing the product of the multiplication between A and B.

__Outputs:__ <br/>
For each test case you must print the integers A and B separated by spaces.

__Limits:__ <br/>
Maximum time for each test case: 20s A, B < K <= 10^9. <br/>
P < 1000000

__Examples:__ <br/>
